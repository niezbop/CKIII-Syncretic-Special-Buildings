[h1]About[/h1]

[b]Syncretic Special Buildings[/b] is a simple mod that makes special buildings that require specific religions to be usable by religions with syncretism.

[h1]Features[/h1]
As explained above, the only feature of this mod is making all special religious buildings accessible to syncretic faiths.

For example, Notre-Dame de Paris, a special cathedral for the catholics is now usable for the Basque pagans, provided they have kept the [b]Christian Syncretism[/b]!

For a full list of buildings changed, please check the pinned discussion.
